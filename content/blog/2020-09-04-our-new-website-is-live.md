So we have a new website! Not that our previous one was ever really visited and enjoyed but that is part of the reason we are building this new one. The previous website was some sort of portfolio for myself and that turned out to be pretty useless.

Not long ago I started writing some stuff on my [personal dev.to profile](https://dev.to/eberfreitas) about the new things I've been learning and I thought it would be nice to have those posts on a place I could control. Along with that, I keep having these ideas that I wanna tackle and put under Zyglab's "brand". Things like open source software, educational content, and so on.

Let's make this website useful by aggregating all of those initiatives!

You might have seen those three huge words on our home page... I wanna write more about that on some sort of "about" page but the idea is that those three words describe nicely the principles that will guide our actions under the Zyglab's name hopefully.

A few fun things about the new website:

- It was made with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in Rust which works super well and I'm really satisfied with;
- The design is really simple, mostly because I'm lazy and wanted to put out something quickly. I still managed to take too long to make this but I'm ok with that;
- The simplicity of the design is also reflected by how little resources I tried to use. Look, mom! No custom fonts;
- I already posted my previous posts from dev.to here so you can check them out [here](/blog);
- This website is hosted by Github and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/zyglab/zyglab.github.io) so if you find any typos or misconceptions feel free to open an issue or PR;
- Every content on this website is also being translated to Portuguese (my native tongue).

That is it. I'm really excited about things to come. We already have a small project on the works... I won't share too much for now as I don't know how long it will take to actually have something to show.

In the meantime, I have a small backlog of topics I wanna write about on this blog so stay tuned! Follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/zyglab) to know about new posts, projects, and ideas or subscribe to our feed!

See you soon!
